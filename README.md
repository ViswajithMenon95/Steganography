# Steganography

#This project aims to embed data in an image and then retrieve it back.

#Steps

#2. Run steganography-encryption.py. You will be prompted for the secret message and the passcode.
#3. The encrypted image 'encryptedImage.png' will then be generated with the embedded message.
#4. Next, run steganography-decryption.py. You will prompted for the passcode.
#5. On entering the correct passcode, the original secret message will be displayed.
